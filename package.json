You need to set `autoResize` property to `true` to use the shrinking feature.\n- Added `ResizeHandle` component. This special component can be added to your layout to resize a given `target` when dragging it. This component is currently used in the new resizable `Popover` element.\n- Added `resizable` and `resizableDirection` properties in `Popover` class. You are now able to resize a `Popover` using the bottom-right corner of the popover pane. A resizable Popover will not be repositionned.\n- Added Clipboard handling support for **UTF8 Text** and **PNG** format on _iOS_, _Windows_, _macOS_, and _Linux_ platforms. Please refer to the **Native Integration** documentation page for more information.\n\n### Changed\n\n- App UI shaders are now optionally embedded in Player builds. You can change this setting in your main App UI settings instance. The default value is `true`.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed Dark Gray 1200 color value in Design Tokens for Editor-Dark theme.\n- Fixed a bug where `Popover` elements were not correctly anchored in Unity versions older than 6.\n- Fixed usage of AppCompat theme for AppUI GameActivity on Android platform.\n- Fixed an exception thrown when trying to update UXML schemas in the Editor.\n- Register trickledown events for popups on the first child of the visual tree root element instead of the root element itself to avoid leaks."}}
